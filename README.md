# yarn-gift-help-1.0
Inital version of The Yarn Gift Helper app - worsted/medium weight sweater.

The Yarn Gift Helper is designed to help non-knitters know how much yarn to gift the knitters in their life. 

With over 240,000 different yarns in the world*, many different thicknesses ("weights"), and yarn brands having different lengths of yarn in each ball/skein, it definately can be confusing.

Yarn Gift Helper is designed to help non-knitters quickly figure out how much yarn to buy for their family members and friends who are knitters - without spending hours learning about yarn. This current edition is just for pullover sweaters/jumpers made with medium thickness yarn. Over the next year (2022-2023), it will be expanded to include different weights (thickness) of yarn and different types of project (eg mitten and hat sets).


## VERSION 1.0: 

This current initial release (1.0) of the Yarn Gift Helper has been quickly adapted in an afternoon from a Scrimba Frontend Developer Career Path solo project (unit convertor). The inital idea for The Yarn Gift Helper was this codepen by Brad Travesy that I coded along with and refactored with Bootstrap 5 in early 2022.

## FUTURE VERSION 2.0:

Accessibility and being able to view on a variety of device sizes are both important. The 2.0 release of The Yarn Gift Helper will be a redesign that includes a responsive layout, accessible first design, and most likely a dark/light theme switcher.

## Future Plans: 

The Yarn Gift Helper app will eventually connect to the Ravelry.com yarn database ("api") of 240,475 yarns so users can search by yarn name and have the yardage automatically inputted for them. When this happens and goes live depends on the time I have to develop this further.
